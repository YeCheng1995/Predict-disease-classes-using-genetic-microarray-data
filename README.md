# Project Description


This project will compare the data of a disease on a gene with the data of other diseases on this gene to calculate the T value. Therefore, each gene will have five t-values, and then we will sort the t-values of each disease and select the genes related to disease comparison. Finally, this project will compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of classifiers, and give a chart to show the relationship between error rate and gene number. This project will use python, sklearn, and Jupiter notebook to complete the task.
